      WINDING-UP THE DISCUSSION HERE. LET'S SEE WHAT POP-CULTURE IS ALL ABOUT!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ergo, we read what all sources of Pop-Culture do affect the youths,
      prefferably or adversely.
      <br />
      In the modern West, pop culture refers to cultural products such as music,
      art, literature, fashion, dance, film, cyberculture, television, and radio
      that are consumed by the majority of a society's population. Popular
      culture is those types of media that have mass accessibility and appeal.
      <br />Examples of popular culture come from a wide array of genres,
      including popular music, print, cyber culture, sports, entertainment,
      leisure, fads, advertising and television. Sports and television are
      arguably two of the most widely consumed examples of popular culture, and
      they also represent two examples of popular culture with great staying
      power. Sports are played and watched by members of all social classes, but
      (tautologously) the masses are responsible for the huge popularity of
      sports. Some sporting events, such as the World Cup and the Olympics, are
      consumed by a world community. Sports are pervasive in most societies and
      represent a major part of many people’s lives. Showing allegiance to a
      team as a means of self-identification is a common behavior. Further,
      cheering for a sports team or a favorite athlete is a way any individual
      can become part of popular culture, as I and Tim Madigan explain in our
      new book The Sociology of Sport. Many people watch numerous hours of
      television everyday. It is such a prevalent aspect of contemporary culture
      it is difficult to imagine life without it. There are those who believe TV
      is responsible for the dumbing down of society; that children watch too
      much television; and that the couch potato syndrome has contributed to the
      epidemic of childhood obesity. The globally popular TV show The Simpsons
      provides us with an interesting perspective on television. In the episode
      ‘Sideshow Bob’s Last Gleaming’ (#137), while doing time in prison,
      Sideshow Bob becomes a critic of television. Although he was once a
      regular on The Krusty the Clown Show, Bob has become obsessed by
      television’s harmful effect on society. Bob argues that everyone’s lives
      would be much richer if TV were done away with. As a result, he devises a
      scheme to detonate a nuclear bomb unless all television is abolished in
      Springfield. Unable to locate Bob, Springfield’s city officials meet to
      discuss Bob’s demands of abolishing TV. A panicky Krusty proclaims, “Would
      it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the
      survivors would envy the dead.” Although there are people who agree with
      Sideshow Bob, the masses would more likely agree with Krusty: that living
      in a world without television is not really living. It is even more
      difficult to imagine a world without popular culture.
