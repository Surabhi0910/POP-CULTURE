    <h2 class="about">FORMATION OF POP CULTURE</h2>
    <p>
      The term "popular culture" was coined in the 19th century or earlier.
      Traditionally, popular culture was associated with poor education and with
      the lower classes, as opposed to the "official culture" and higher
      education of the upper classes. Victorian-era With the rise of the
      <div>
      Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Britain
      experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates, and
      with the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend
      more money on entertainment, like the commercial idea of pubs and sports.
      Reading also gained traction. Labelling penny dreadfuls the Victorian
      equivalent of video games, The Guardian in 2016 described penny fiction as
      "Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young". A
      growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the
      newly-invented railway (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington
      Railway, opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for
      cheap popular literature, and the ability for its distribution on a large
      scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this
      demand.
      <br />
     
      The stress in the distinction from "official culture" became more
      pronounced towards the end of the 19th century,a usage that became
      established by the interbellum period.
      <br />
      From the end of World War II, following major cultural and social changes
      brought by mass media innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to
      overlap with those of mass culture, media culture, image culture, consumer
      culture, and culture for mass consumption. Social and cultural changes in
      the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western
      countries.</div>
      </p>
      <p>
      <br />
      The abbreviated form "pop" for popular, as in pop music, dates from the
      late 1950s. Although terms "pop" and "popular" are in some cases used
      interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term "pop" is
      narrower. Pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass
      appeal, while "popular" refers to what has gained popularity, regardless
      of its style.
