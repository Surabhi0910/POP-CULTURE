    <h2 class="about">THE CRITICISM FACED BY POPULAR CULTURE</h2>
    <div class="one">
    <h3>CULTURE INDUSTRY:</h3>
    <p>
      <div >The most influential critiques of popular culture came from Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School during the
      twentieth century. Adorno and Horkheimer analysed the dangers of the culture industry in their influential work the
      Dialectic of Enlightenment by drawing upon the works of Kant, Marx, Nietzsche and others. Capitalist popular culture, as
      Adorno argued, was not an authentic culture of the people but a system of homogenous and standardised artworks produced
      in the service of capitalist domination by the elite. The consumer demand for Hollywood films, pop tunes and consumable
      books is encouraged by the hegemony of the corporate elite who control the media and the corporations. Adorno wrote,
      “The industry bows to the vote it has itself rigged”. It is the elite who commodify products in accordance with
      their narrow ideological values and criteria, and Adorno argues that the audience becomes accustomed to these formulaic
      conventions, making intellectual contemplation impossible. Adorno’s work has had a considerable influence on culture
      studies, philosophy and the New Left. Writing in the New Yorker in 2014, music critic Alex Ross, argued that
      Adorno's work has a renewed importance in the digital age: "The pop hegemony is all but complete, its superstars
      dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons...Culture appears more monolithic than ever, with a few
      gigantic corporations—Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon—presiding over unprecedented monopolies.
      
      Scholar Jack Zipes critiqued the mass commercialisation and corporate hegemony behind the Harry Potter franchise. He
      argued that the commodities of the culture industry are “popular” because they are homogenous and obey standard
      conventions; the media then influences the tastes of children. In his analysis of Harry Potter’s global brand, Zipes
      wrote, “It must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in
      general. To be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what
      makes up a phenomenon ”</div>

    <h3>PROPAGANDA:</h3>
    <p>
      <div >Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky critiqued the mass media in their 1988 work Manufacturing Consent: The Political
      Economy of the Mass Media. They argue that mass media is controlled by a powerful hegemonic elite who are motivated by
      their own interests that determine and manipulate what information is present in the mainstream. The mass media is
      therefore a system of propaganda.
      
      "In sum, a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a systematic and highly political dichotomization in news
      coverage based on serviceability to important domestic power interests. This should be observable in dichotomized
      choices of story and in the volume and quality of coverage... such dichotomization in the mass media is massive and
      systematic: not only are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of system advantage, but the
      modes of handling favored and inconvenient materials (placement, tone, context, fullness of treatment) differ in ways
      that serve political ends."</div>

    <h3>CONSUMERISM:</h3>
    <p>
      <div >According to the postmodern sociologist Baudrillard, the individual is trained into the duty of seeking the relentless
      maximisation of pleasure lest he or she become asocial.  Therefore, “enjoyment” and “fun” become indistinguishable
      from the need to consume. Whereas the Frankfurt School believed consumers were passive, Baudrillard argued that
      consumers were trained to consume products in a form of active labour in order to achieve upward social mobility.
      Thus, consumers under capitalism are trained to purchase products such as pop albums and consumable fiction in order to
      signal their devotion to social trends, fashions and subcultures. Although the consumption may arise from an active
      choice, the choice is still the consequence of a social conditioning which the individual is unconscious of. Baudrillard
      says, “One is permanently governed by a code whose rules and meaning-constraints — like those of language — are, for the
      most part, beyond the grasp of individuals”.
      
      In Baudrillard's understanding, the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion,
      since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview:
      
      "The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction.
      Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling
      Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message. The message of The Matrix is its own diffusion by an uncontrollable and
      proliferating contamination."</div>
