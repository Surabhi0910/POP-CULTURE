    <h2 class="about">ABOUT POP CULTURE</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <span>Popular culture</span>
      (also called mass culture and pop culture) is generally recognized by
      members of a society as a set of the practices, beliefs, and objects that
      are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time. Popular
      culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result
      of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in modern
      times by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives
      of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of
      influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics. However,
      there are various ways to define pop culture. Because of this, popular
      culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways
      by different people across different contexts. It is generally viewed in
      contrast to other forms of culture such as folk culture, working-class
      culture, or high culture, and also through different theoretical
      perspectives such as psychoanalysis, structuralism, postmodernism, and
      more. The most common pop-culture categories are: entertainment (such as
      film, music, television and video games), sports, news (as in
      people/places in the news), politics, fashion, technology, and slang.

      Popular culture in the West has been critiqued for its being a system of
      commercialism that privileges products selected and mass-marketed by the
      upper-class capitalist elite; such criticisms are most notable in many
      Marxist theorists such as Marcuse, Adorno, Horkheimer, Gramsci, Debord,
      Jameson, Eagleton, as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as
      Lyotard, who has written about the commercialisation of information under
      capitalism, and Baudrillard, as well as others.
      <br />
      The term "popular culture" was coined in the 19th century or
      earlier.Traditionally, popular culture was associated with poor education
      and with the lower classes, as opposed to the "official culture" and
      higher education of the upper classes. Victorian-era With the rise of the
      Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Britain
      experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates, and
      with the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend
      more money on entertainment, like the commercial idea of pubs and sports.
      Reading also gained traction.

      A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the
      newly-invented railway (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington
      Railway, opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for
      cheap popular literature, and the ability for its distribution on a large
      scale.

      From the end of World War II, following major cultural and social changes
      brought by mass media innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to
      overlap with those of mass culture, media culture, image culture, consumer
      culture, and culture for mass consumption. Social and cultural changes in
      the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western
      countries. Although terms "pop" and "popular" are in some cases used
      interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term "pop" is
      narrower. Pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass
      appeal, while "popular" refers to what has gained popularity, regardless
      of its style.

    <h3>DEFINITION:</h3>
    <p></p>
    <div>
      
        The quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much "high
        culture" (e.g., television dramatizations of Jane Austen) is also
        "popular." "Pop culture" is also defined as the culture that is
        "leftover" when we have decided what high culture is.A third definition
        equates pop culture with "mass culture" and ideas. This is seen as a
        commercial culture, mass-produced for mass consumption by mass media.
        From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to American
        culture.

        "Pop culture" can be defined as an "authentic" culture of the people,
        but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the
        people. A postmodernist approach to popular culture would "no longer
        recognize the distinction between high and popular culture."
        <br />
        Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and
        time. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually
        interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its
        institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop
        culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a subculture, representing
        perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited
        familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad
        spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for
        understanding what popular culture means have been given by the German
        researcher Ronald Daus, who studies the impact of extra-European
        cultures in North America, Asia, and especially in Latin America.

        Within the realm of popular culture, there exists a organizational
        culture. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes
        in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there
        are three levels that have emerged, high and low. High culture can be
        described as art and works considered of superior value, historically,
        aesthetically and socially. Low culture is regarded by some as that of
        the lower classes, historically.

    <h3>FOLKLORE:</h3>

    <div>
      
        Adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular
        culture. This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today,
        in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by
        word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of jokes or
        urban legends. With the widespread use of the Internet from the 1990s,
        the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurred.
        Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with
        the commercial element, communities amongst the public have their own
        tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural
        item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of
        commercial culture may spread by word-of-mouth, and become modified in
        the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.
